# Lithobot
These are the codes and submitted  paper for lithobot application. It is an Auto ML code to predict lithofacies from well logs. 

# Their are two files :
1. training.py
2. user_file.py 

In the file: training.py you will find the automatic data loading from force-2020 website, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, training of several models and predictions on test data. 
In the file: user_file.py user can upload their own data file and we will predict the output lithofacies based on their dataset.
